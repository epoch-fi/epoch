# Epoch

Epoch is a one-stop solution for advanced and professional investors to access all investment-related knowledge in a personalized, distilled, and interactive manner. This repository contains both the UI and server code for the Epoch. The UI is a Nextjs app, that can also be deployed to Vercel. The server is a fastapi server, which primarily leverages open source APIs to fetch data real-time. We also have a database of some key company metrics, which we'll try to host and maintain ourselves.

The hosted version of this code is deployed at https://www.epoch-fi.com/
